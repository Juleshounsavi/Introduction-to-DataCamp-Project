# Introduction-to-DataCamp-Project
This is a DataCamp project! Projects allow you to practice and apply the skills you've learned in the DataCamp courses. In each project you carry out an end-to-end analysis, on a real-world task, using real-world tools and workflows. The exception is this project, which is just an introduction to the DataCamp project interface.
